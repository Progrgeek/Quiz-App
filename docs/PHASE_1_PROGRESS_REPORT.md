## üöÄ **Running Services**

### Development Environment
- **Main App**: http://localhost:5173 ‚úÖ Running
- **Storybook**: http://localhost:6006 ‚úÖ Running
- **Components**: All UI components functional and tested

### Component Library Status
- **Design System**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and integrated
- **Core Components**: ‚úÖ 4 components ready for production use
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Complete with interactive examples
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ Infrastructure ready for comprehensive testing

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Maintained Quiz Compatibility**: All existing Quiz functionality preserved
2. **Modular Design**: Components can be used independently or together
3. **Design System First**: Tokens drive all styling decisions
4. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 compliance built into every component
5. **Performance Optimized**: Framer Motion for smooth animations

### Integration Approach
- **Non-Breaking**: No changes to existing Quiz components
- **Additive**: New components extend functionality without replacement
- **Flexible**: Components work in Quiz context and standalone
- **Scalable**: Foundation supports rapid component development
